    usb reminder
    have you ever forgotten your usb stick after using it on some PC? I have. Here's a little app to make sure we don't slap our foreheads in the evening again, at least for this reason.
    
    usb plugged in
        copy program to desktop
        run copy on desktop
        create directory on desktop
        
        change wallpaper to 'Take your USB stick!
        
    #U pressed
        change wallpaper back
        move directory to usb
        eject usb stick
